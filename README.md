This is my first version of a base engine in MonoGame.

It contains structures such as GameObjects, Colliders, Layering, Aseprite Tilemap support, as well as an automatic tilemap collider creator.

It's far from being good, and bugs are sure to arise still, but for me, it still serves as a good starting point, from which I can persoanlly continue to work and improve on.
